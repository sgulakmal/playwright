Playwright API Testing Project
Overview
This project uses Playwright to automate and test API responses, ensuring that they meet expected outcomes. Playwright provides a powerful platform for running browser-based tests, but it's also incredibly useful for API testing due to its support for network operations.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)
A text editor or IDE of your choice
Basic understanding of JavaScript and API concepts
Installation
Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory
bash
Copy code
cd <project-directory-name>
Install dependencies
bash
Copy code
npm install
Configuration
Before running the tests, ensure your environment is properly set up:

Set up environment variables (if your project uses them) by creating a .env file in the root of your project. Refer to .env.example for the required format.

Update the playwright.config.js file with any project-specific settings, including API base URLs, timeout settings, or custom report paths.

Writing Tests
Tests are located in the tests directory. To add a new test, create a .spec.js file in the appropriate subdirectory. Use Playwright's API to send requests and assert responses:

javascript
Copy code
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test('API should return 200 status', async ({ request }) => {
  const response = await request.get('/your-api-endpoint');
  expect(response.status()).toBe(200);
});
Running Tests
To run all tests, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npx playwright test
To run a specific test file:

bash
Copy code
npx playwright test tests/path/to/your-test.spec.js
Viewing Reports
By default, this project is configured to generate HTML reports. To view them, after test execution, open the generated report in your browser:

bash
Copy code
npx playwright show-report
